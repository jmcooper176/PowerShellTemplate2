# Security

I take security seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through GitHub organizations, which include [jmcooper176](https://github.com/jmcooper176)

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability meeting this definition -- [jmcooper176 definition of a security vulnerability](https://), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by directly to (John Merryweather Cooper) at [https://](https://security/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [jmcooper8654@gmail.com](mailto:jmcooper8654@gmail.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [John Merryweather Cooper's PGP Key page](https://security/pgpkey).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://aka.ms/opensource/security/msrc). 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Technical Type of Issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.  My German is rusty, but serviceable.  My Spanish is morbund.  All other non-software languages are beyond the pale.

## Policy

jmcooper176 follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://security/cvd).
